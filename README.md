# AgropontosRegex

Agropontos Regex is a small Python program to extract geolocation coordinates from PDF files, eg.: rural property registration documents.

It works for two types of coordinates, UTM and Lat-Long. And generates a CSV file that can be imported directly to GIS software, like QGIS.

The program interface can be used like a notepad to correct any errors or wrong characters brought by the OCR scanning. It also generates a new PDF file correcting the page angles and rotation.
